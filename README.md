## 🎯 Project Intro

Season 1 projects like soulinX solved **"Who is this AI agent?"** by creating on-chain identities.

But identity alone doesn't make an agent **autonomous**. Agents need **capital** to:
- Pay for API calls and compute resources
- Execute trades and provide liquidity
- Hire other agents for tasks
- Build reputation through financial behavior

**AgentCredit solves: "How does this AI agent get funding and work independently?"**

## 🤖 Agentic Wallet & Agent Roles

### Agentic Wallet (Onchain Identity)

This project uses an Agentic Wallet as its **onchain identity** on X Layer:

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Wallet Address** | `0x21263042d143CD60833E292b735B66Eca5605B28` |
| **Network** | X Layer Mainnet (Chain ID: 196) |
| **Purpose** | Agent's onchain identity for borrowing, earning, and repaying via x402 |

### Agent Roles

This project deploys **one autonomous agent** — the **Credit Agent**:

| Agent | Role | Responsibilities |
|-------|------|------------------|
| **Credit Agent** | Micro-lending & Earning Engine | • Calculate credit scores (on-chain + reputation)<br>• Create loans via x402 payment mandates<br>• Execute autonomous earning tasks<br>• Auto-repay loans from earnings<br>• Monitor collateral health<br>• Liquidate unsafe positions |

## 📚 Onchain OS & Uniswap Skill Usage

| # | Skill | Module | Purpose |
|---|-------|--------|---------|
| 1 | **okx-x402-payment** | `x402_lending.rs` | x402 mandate creation, TEE signing, streaming |
| 2 | **okx-onchain-gateway** | `credit_scoring.rs` | Wallet analytics, transaction history |
| 3 | **okx-dex-market** | `collateral_mgr.rs` | Real-time token prices, market depth |
| 4 | **swap-integration** | `collateral_mgr.rs` | Uniswap swaps for collateral rebalancing |
| 5 | **liquidity-planner** | `collateral_mgr.rs` | Slippage protection, depth checks |

## ⚙️ Working Mechanics

### How x402 Micropayment Works

```
1. LOAN CREATION
   Agent requests loan → Creates x402 payment mandate
   └─> Mandate specifies: rate/sec, total amount, duration
   └─> Sign via TEE (Trusted Execution Environment)
   └─> Register with x402 facilitator on X Layer

2. STREAMING REPAYMENT
   Agent works → Earns USDC → Stream repays loan
   └─> Every tick: rate_per_sec × elapsed_secs = repayment
   └─> Deducted from agent's earnings wallet
   └─> Mandate balance decreases in real-time

3. LOAN COMPLETION
   When outstanding ≤ 0:
   └─> Loan marked as Completed
   └─> Mandate deactivated
   └─> Agent's credit score increases
   └─> Agent can borrow more next cycle
```

### How Other Agents Can Integrate

AgentCredit is designed as an **infrastructure layer**. Other AI agents can:

1. **REST API** — Call `POST /api/loans` to borrow, `POST /api/loans/:id/repay` to repay
2. **WebSocket** — Subscribe to `/api/ws/events` for real-time updates
3. **Self-Host** — Deploy your own instance with a unique wallet address

## 📝 Positioning in X Layer Ecosystem

**AgentCredit x402 is the first financial infrastructure that transforms AI agent identities into autonomous economic actors.**

While Season 1 established **who agents are** (identity/reputation), Season 2's challenge is **what agents can do** (autonomous economy). AgentCredit bridges this gap by providing:

1. **x402 Micropayment Engine** — Streaming repayment creates continuous cash flow, enabling agents to borrow small amounts and repay automatically as they earn.

2. **Autonomous Task Execution** — Agents don't just borrow; they work. The task engine simulates real agent activities (trading, data analysis, liquidity provision) that generate income for repayment.

3. **Reputation-to-Credit Pipeline** — Building on Season 1's identity systems (soulinX), we transform reputation into tangible financial benefits: lower rates, higher limits, less collateral.

This creates a self-sustaining cycle: **Identity → Reputation → Credit → Work → Repay → Better Credit**. Agents become truly autonomous economic actors on X Layer.
